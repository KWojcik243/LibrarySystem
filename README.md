# LibrarySystem
 ##  Library system is a web app that libraries can use for themselves and their users. ##
 Each superuser (like admin, or the lady from the library) can add/delete authors and books, adds new superuser, check order(borrowed or reserved books) status.
 Each normal user can search for books by their name, or author. They can make a reservation for 1 day, or cancel it.
